## Sem3-RC-Mandelbrot

This is a TCP/IP project me and my colleague [@NinthBurn](https://www.github.com/NinthBurn) made for our Computer Networks class.  
It includes a server and a client:
- The server does not draw anything, but opens a window made using EasyGraphics in Python 3.
- The clients can connect to the server, and they will receive instructions on what to draw & send it back to the server.

There are two implementations of the client - one in Python (original) and another in C++ (by my colleague).  
I kindly thank him for his tremendous work on deciphering weird Socket API bugs.
